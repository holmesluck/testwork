                      <p class="p1">
                          “Computer needs to be used. If you don’t, it would meaningless.” This is what I been told by my mum since I was a little kid, which is also turned into my creed in life. Computer science, to most ordinaries, is tedious and complicated. To me, however, the fantastic part of computer science is its mystique and process in finding solutions, which also playing as the key role in pushing forward the advance of history. Now, I am applying the postgraduate programme, hoping that with your seasoned guidance, I could be given a chance to set my foot in IT, which is the field I would dedicate my entire life to.

                      <p class="p2">
                      Yeas majored in Software Engineering have shaped me into a man with precise mathematical logic and abundant creativity, since Software Engineering is a science attached to engineering. Computer science was not easy for me at first, probably caused by lacking effective study method and passion to this field. However, the more I had access to this field, the more I found myself fall in love with it and gradually grown a general picture about how these bald codes and programmes were used changing daily life and human history. Before I graduated, I have got comforting records in my transcript, for instance, 93 for Project of Computer Operating System, 90 for J2EE Software Development Practice Course, 85 for Software Project Management and Quality Engineering. My graduate thesis, The Extraction and Analysis of Content on Website of Taobao, has also awarded the Excellent Graduate Thesis, for the method I picked to study the application in C language, data encryption and data vision. My passion and enthusiasm to computer science enable me to embrace new knowledge and advanced concepts in information technology.

                          Computer science is more “real” than theoretical; proficiency in it, therefore, must be tested through field work. In a university association, which is established for free computer repair, I not only gained practical computer repairing skills, but also exchanged valuable experiences with other members. Besides, my practical course, J2EE Software Development Practice Course, provides me another chance to keep up with new technology while communicating, resource allocating and enhancing my interesting in software engineering. However, my practice was confined in university only. Last year, I interned in a company named Beyondsoft, which is the famous IT service company in Asia, as intern responsible for software testing in Test Department. Although short-term it was, my experience accumulated was priceless. Software testing requires abundant experience and cautious attitude, meanwhile unthinkable patient, while testing. More importantly, through English summary I handed in everyday, a lot of problems, solutions and ideas were recorded and enquired to my mentor to improve my comprehension to the practicability of software. With these practical skills, I would gain a more in-depth comprehension to information technology than someone who doesn’t.

                          Although absorbed a lot in computer in last 4 year, I still consider myself a green hand that needed to be trained badly. Thus, I have decided to seek my further in your university and experience the education under a different social ideology. Information Technology Management programme provides a transformational experience in integrating the technological and managerial sides of IT, which offering a perfect chance for me to build my career in information technology. Once overseas education is completed, I intend to pursue a position in HUAWEI as an experienced and professional software architect.

                          Being a fully developed individual with a clear occupation plan, I would spare no effort to be an achiever and contribute to the diversity and intellectual development to Hong Kong Baptist University. Truly hope you can give my application a serious consideration and await your early reply.
